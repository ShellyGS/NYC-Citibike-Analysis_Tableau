# ﻿NYC Citibike Analysis - Tableau

## Background:

As the new lead analyst for the [New York Citi BikeLinks to an external site.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) program, I am  now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, I am expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site.](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

## Objective:

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so my first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## Data considered:

The data taken into consideration is of the whole year starting from Aug 2022 – July 2023. The data was extracted in CVS format from the CitiBike System data website here (<https://citibikenyc.com/system-data>)

## Dashboard process:

1. Collect the data and import the data in Tableau public here (<https://public.tableau.com/app/discover>)
1. Worksheets were created based on the various questions to analyse the data. I made 17 worksheets, each worksheet providing the story points.
1. Once complete, I made 5 dashboards which involves the worksheet, each telling a story about the citibike on different parameters.
1. After that, I created a Storyboard using these dashboards, connecting and conveying a story about the citibike and the findings on different paraments.

The tableau dashboard is available here (<https://public.tableau.com/views/NYCCitibikeAnalysis_16950829208490/NYCCITIBIKEANALYSIS?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link>)
